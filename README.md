# Breast Cancer Detection Project

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to detect breast cancer based on certain features extracted from breast biopsy samples. The goal is to classify whether a tumor is malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) based on the provided dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set](httpsarchive.ics.uci.edumldatasetsBreast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass, which describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

## Project Structure
- Data Exploration Analyze and visualize the dataset to gain insights into the distribution of features and their relationship with the target variable.
- Data Preprocessing Prepare the dataset for model training by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features if necessary.
- Model Development Train machine learning models using various algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, etc., to classify tumors as malignant or benign.
- Model Evaluation Evaluate the performance of trained models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score.
- Hyperparameter Tuning Fine-tune the parameters of the best-performing model to improve its performance.
- Deployment Deploy the trained model in a production environment, allowing users to make predictions on new data.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
